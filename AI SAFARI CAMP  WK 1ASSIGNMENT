Case 1: The Broken Coffee Machine

☕

What’s happening:
In the office kitchen, the coffee machine has been out of order for two weeks. Employees keep gathering around it, hoping for a miracle, only to walk away disappointed.

What’s problematic:
The broken machine is slowing down morning routines and hurting morale. People either skip coffee (and start the day grumpy) or waste time making long café runs. Productivity is taking a hit.

One improvement idea:
Instead of waiting on a repair guy “sometime soon,” management could rent a backup machine or arrange a coffee delivery service. That way, caffeine flows while repairs are sorted.

Case 2: The Endless Zoom Call

📹

What’s happening:
A weekly team meeting scheduled for 30 minutes always drags into an hour and a half. Most attendees are muted, multitasking, and zoning out.

What’s problematic:
The call wastes time, drains focus, and creates frustration. Key decisions still get postponed, making the whole ritual feel pointless.

One improvement idea:
Adopt a “stand-up style” meeting: 30 minutes max, everyone answers just three questions — What did I do? What am I doing? Where do I need help? Clear, fast, and focused.

👉 Do you want me to polish these more into a casual storytelling blog voice (like a productivity blog), or keep them crisp and professional (like internal case notes)?
